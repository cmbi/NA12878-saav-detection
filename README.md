# gm12878 project
Project relating to detection of variants on the transcript and protein level of NA12878

Repository for the creation of customized protein sequences and analysis of ionbot output to understand if:

- Variants can truly be detected on the peptide level
- A proteogenomics approach using custom databases is necessary to identify variant peptides
- Ionbot and other cutting-edge spectral matching tools sensitive enough to distinguish true SNVs
